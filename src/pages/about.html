            However, it‚Äôs crucial to understand that off-plan investment isn‚Äôt
            without challenges. Investors must consider construction risks such
            as delays or plan changes, potential market fluctuations during the

          Success in off-plan investment requires a specific investor profile

          tolerance, the ability to commit capital for extended periods, and
          comfort with less liquid investments. Key strategies for success
          include conducting thorough market research to understand local trends
          and future development plans, rigorous vetting of developers‚Äô track
          records and financial health, careful review of all legal obligations,
          and strategic planning for exit strategies, whether through resale or
